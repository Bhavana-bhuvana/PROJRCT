# **Literature Survey on Zero-Code ML Model**  

## **1. Introduction**  
The rise of **no-code and low-code platforms** has made it easier for non-technical users to build software applications. In machine learning (ML), **AutoML (Automated Machine Learning)** has enabled users to develop predictive models without manual coding. This literature survey explores existing research and tools related to **no-code ML**, **AutoML frameworks**, and **challenges in ML automation**.

## **2. Existing Work on No-Code & AutoML Platforms**  

### **2.1 AutoML and Its Evolution**  
AutoML systems automate tasks like **feature selection, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment**. Several studies highlight the efficiency of AutoML in simplifying ML workflows:  

- **Feurer et al. (2015)** introduced **Auto-sklearn**, an AutoML system that optimizes ML pipelines.  
- **Hutter et al. (2019)** developed **Auto-PyTorch**, an extension for deep learning AutoML.  
- **Google AutoML (2018)** allows users to train custom models without writing code.  

 **Relevance to Zero-Code ML:** These studies provide insights into **automated model selection, training, and optimization**, which are core features of a no-code ML system.

### **2.2 No-Code ML Platforms**  
Several commercial and open-source no-code ML tools exist:  

| **Tool** | **Features** | **Limitations** |  
|----------|-------------|----------------|  
| **Google AutoML** | Prebuilt ML models, drag-and-drop UI | Limited customization |  
| **DataRobot** | Automated feature engineering, model deployment | Expensive for small businesses |  
| **H2O AutoML** | Open-source, supports deep learning | Requires basic ML knowledge |  

- **Mendon√ßa et al. (2021)** analyzed no-code ML tools and found that most still require **domain expertise**.  
- **Wu et al. (2022)** highlighted UI/UX challenges in making AutoML tools fully no-code.  

 **Relevance to Zero-Code ML:** The survey helps in designing an intuitive UI that minimizes the **learning curve** for non-experts.

## **3. Challenges in No-Code ML Systems**  

### **3.1 Data Preprocessing & Quality Issues**  
- **Zhang et al. (2020)** found that **80% of ML development time** is spent on **data cleaning**.  
- **Kandel et al. (2011)** emphasized the need for **automated preprocessing** to ensure data quality.  

 **Solution for Zero-Code ML:** Implementing **automated data validation** and **error handling mechanisms**.  

### **3.2 Model Explainability**  
- **Lundberg & Lee (2017)** introduced **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** for interpreting ML models.  
- **Doshi-Velez & Kim (2017)** stressed that black-box models in AutoML can reduce user trust.  

 **Solution for Zero-Code ML:** Integrate **explainability tools** (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to help users understand model predictions.

## **4. Summary of Key Findings**  

| **Aspect** | **Findings** | **Implications for Zero-Code ML** |  
|------------|-------------|--------------------------------|  
| **AutoML** | Simplifies model selection & training | Helps automate the ML pipeline |  
| **No-Code ML Tools** | Existing tools require basic ML knowledge | UI should be **fully no-code** |  
| **Data Quality** | Preprocessing is a major bottleneck | Need for **automated data cleaning** |  
| **Model Interpretability** | Users need transparency in ML models | Include **explainability tools** |  

---

## **5. Conclusion**  
This literature survey highlights the evolution of **AutoML, existing no-code ML tools, and challenges in automation**. To develop an effective **Zero-Code ML Model**, the system should:  
**Provide an intuitive UI** for complete automation.  
**Automate data preprocessing** to minimize manual effort.  
**Ensure model explainability** for user trust.
